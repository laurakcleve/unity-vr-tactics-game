The beginnings of a VR turn-based fantasy tactics game. Created in Unity for SteamVR, using [VRTK](https://vrtoolkit.readme.io/).

- Turns progress between all units
- Player turns allow a movement and an attack
- AI controlled units move to and attack nearest enemy
- All units move via A\* pathfinding

An early demo:

Character model is [Unity-Chan!](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/unity-chan-model-18705), all other models created by me.
